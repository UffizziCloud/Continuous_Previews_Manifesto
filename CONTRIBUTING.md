The CP Manifesto welcomes all contributions from everyone, not just Pull Requests. You can also help by filing detailed bug reports, proposing new features, and sharing Continuous Previews with your local community.

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://kcd.im/pull-request)
